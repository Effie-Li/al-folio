I am a final year PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University, advised by [Jay McClelland](https://stanford.edu/~jlmcc/).  I am interested in human-like AI, machine/human cognition, and mechanistic understanding of neural networks.  

My research focuses on how structured computation can emerge in a continuous system over learning and how this supports higher-level cognitive abilities such as task decomposition and goal-directed planning. My work has explored what inductive biases, representations, and learning environments are key to this emergence in both [humans](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009553) and [deep learning models](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oFC2LAqS6Z).

In summer 2024, I will be joining [Meta](https://about.meta.com/) as a research scientist intern. I have previously interned at [AI2](https://allenai.org/) on the PRIOR team, working with [Luca Weihs](https://lucaweihs.github.io/).  Prior to Stanford, I double-majored in Computer Science and Psychology at Trinity College (Connecticut), and worked on building neural decoders of human episodic memory at the Penn Computational Memory Lab.
