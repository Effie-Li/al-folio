I am a fourth year PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University, advised by [Jay McClelland](https://stanford.edu/~jlmcc/).  I am interested in structured decision making and planning as emergent from learning.  My research combines insights from human behavior and advances in deep learning to explore the key computational and representational ingredients that support such emergence across diverse task contexts.

Prior to Stanford, I double-majored in Computer Science and Psychology at Trinity College (Connecticut), and worked on building neural decoders of human episodic memory at the [Penn Computational Memory Lab](https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Main_Page).
